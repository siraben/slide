//! libslide's diagnostic module.
//!
//! libslide does not emit user-facing diagnostic information itself, so the diagnostics returned
//! by libslide should be
//!
//! - as complete as possible, so that a consumer can process as little or as much information as
//!   they want
//! - easily transformable into some output form by downstream customers (namely the slide app)
